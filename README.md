# Task 13: PCA – Dimensionality Reduction

## Objective
To understand dimensionality reduction using PCA and analyze variance-accuracy trade-offs.

## Dataset
- Sklearn Digits Dataset (8x8 images)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and scaled dataset
2. Applied PCA with multiple components
3. Plotted cumulative explained variance
4. Reduced dimensionality
5. Trained Logistic Regression
6. Compared accuracy
7. Visualized PCA 2D projection

## Results
- PCA with 30 components retained ~95% variance
- Accuracy dropped marginally while reducing features by ~50%

## Conclusion
PCA efficiently compresses features with minimal performance loss.
